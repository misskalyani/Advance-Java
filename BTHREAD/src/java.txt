Set B
	a) Write a program to calculate the sum and average of an array of 1000 integers (generated randomly) using 10 threads. Each thread calculates the sum of 100 integers. 
	Use these values to calculate average. [Use join method ].
	b) Write a program for a simple search engine. Accept a string to be searched. Search for the string in all text files in the current folder. Use a separate thread for each file. The 
	result should display the filename, line number where the string is found.
	c) Write a program that implements a multi-thread application that has three threads. First thread generates random integer every 1 second and if the value is even, second 
	thread computes the square of the number and prints. If the value is odd, the third thread will print the value of cube of the number.

Set C
	a) Write a program that simulates a traffic light. The program lets the user select one of three lights: red, yellow, or green with radio buttons. On selecting a button, an 
	appropriate message with “stop” or “ready” or “go”should appear above the buttons in a selected color. Initially there is no message shown.
	b) Write a program to create a thread for moving a ball inside a panel vertically. The ball should be created when the user clicks on the start button.
	c) Using the concepts of thread synchronization create two threads as sender and receiver. Sender thread will set a message to the receiver thread that will display the message on console. The sender 
	thread accepts the input message from console.Continue this process until sender sets the message as “Good Bye Corona”.
